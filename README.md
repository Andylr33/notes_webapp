# notes_webapp
This is my final project that I decided to create for Harvards CS50 course. I decided to build a web application that could allow users to create notes and see them on their screen by creating an account and adding notes on the home page. Users are also able to edit the notes on the same home screen as when they add a note. This web application has taught me how to create user sessions and keep track of when a user is logged in so as to not allow people to have access to certain parts of the website when they should not have access. I learned many lessons in python, flask, html, and javascript and was able to connect to a local database using MySQL, which can be used in even bigger productions for other websites that use databases. This project has taught me a lot of useful tips for many languages and has enabled me to feel more confident in myself as a programmer. Please enjoy my notes website!
